Surgeon surmises that the plastic disc that forms part of the prothesis, may be breaking up in microscopic particles He suggested that I go for another operation and get a hinge prothesis I looked at a photo in the brochure, and noticed that there is also a plastic disc My question is therefore - if the current plastic disc is disintegrating, isn\u2019t the possibility that this will happen again?
